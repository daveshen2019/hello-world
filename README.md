# hello-world
the project is to develop algorithm in AI, ML, and Qubit computing.  Python will be used to prototype
I am Dave Shen, I am an industry veteran in RF/Wireless field.  I have a physics background, and it is always my passion to explore and experiment about natural laws of physics. Recently, I took interest in quantum computing.  I have been experimenting on IBMQ simple althorithms suchs as Grover's Algorithm.  I have started to learn Python and using it to prototype.  Another area of my interest is AI and Deep neutral network learning.  Again, Python has been a very suitable tool with many modules to solve linear algebra.  
While I am just startng using GitHub to manage my development, I hope to quickly gettin to know the community, work with the community and contribute.

best regards,
dave
